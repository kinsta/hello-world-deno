## Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process, 

## Web Server Setup

### Port

Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should **not** hard-code it into the application.

### Start Command

When deploying an application, Kinsta automatically creates a web process with `npm start` as the entry point. Make sure to use this command to run your server.

## Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit) the `npm build` command is run, followed by the `npm start` command.

## What is Deno
Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime that allows you to run code outside of a web browser that allows you to build secure server-side applications. More information is available on the [Deno.land](https://deno.land/) website.
